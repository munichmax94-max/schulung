The previous AI engineer successfully brought the Schulungsportal application from concept to a highly functional MVP. Initial efforts focused on establishing a modern React (frontend) and FastAPI (backend) architecture with MongoDB, adhering to strict environment variable and URL handling rules. The core Access-Key validation system was implemented first, followed by a secure Admin Dashboard with email/password authentication. The engineer then tackled SMTP email integration for Access-Key distribution, including robust debugging for environment variable loading and API endpoint issues. A significant development was the extended course management, introducing a React 19-compatible Markdown editor after resolving a  error. Finally, comprehensive Access-Key and user management features were added, along with a course assignment system. The current work involves implementing interactive quiz functionality, which was requested by the user after the course assignment feature was completed.

The Schulungsportal (Training Portal) is a modern web application designed for authorized users to access training content via a valid Access-Key. Administrators manage all content interactively.

**User Role Requirements:**
*   **Landing Page**: Access-Key input field (Access-Key, Freischalten button).
*   **Content Access**: After successful key validation, access to unlocked training courses (list + detail view).
*   **Progress Tracking (Optional)**: Save progress, quiz results, download materials (PDF/Video).

**Administrator Role Requirements:**
*   **Admin-Dashboard**: Secured login (Email + Password, 2FA initially requested but later opted out).
*   **CRUD Operations**: For courses, chapters/modules, assets (PDF, video, links), quizzes (optional).
*   **Content Release Control**: Manage which content is unlocked by specific keys.
*   **Workflow**: Live preview, draft/publish status, versioning.
*   **Access-Key Management**: Generate and send keys via email (with quantity, validity, course assignment).
*   **Reporting**: Tables with search/filter, audit log for admin actions.

**Access-Key Flow:**
*   Server validates key against database (valid, active, expiry, usage limits).
*   On success: Set session/cookie/JWT, redirect to /kurse.
*   On error: Provide clear error messages (Key ung√ºltig/abgelaufen), rate-limiting/captcha after failures.

**Security Requirements:**
*   Server-side validation for all access.
*   Passwords hashed (Argon2/bcrypt), signed JWTs, HTTPS, CSRF, Rate-Limiting.
*   Role/permission checks (admin vs. user) via middleware.
*   Upload validation, virus scan, signed/time-limited download URLs.
*   Audit-Log for admin actions.

**Frontend Functionality:**
*   Clean UI: Landing (Key input), Course list (search/filter), Course detail with module list, progress display, Weiter navigation, (optional) quiz per module, result feedback.
*   Admin-Dashboard: Course/Module editor (Rich-Text + media), drag-&-drop ordering, publish toggle, key generator, email sending, tables with search/filter, audit log.
*   Responsive, accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA).

**Implemented Features so far:**
*   Access-Key System with validation, JWT, and error handling.
*   User-facing landing page, course list, and detail view (for a placeholder course).
*   Admin Login with email/password (no 2FA).
*   Admin Dashboard with tabs for Courses, Access-Keys, Users, and Email Sending.
*   SMTP email integration (Hostinger) for single and bulk Access-Key distribution.
*   Extended Course Management with Rich-Text (Markdown) editor, module structure, and draft/publish.
*   Extended Access-Key management with statistics, usage tracking, and status.
*   Basic User Management showing activity.
*   Course assignment to Access Keys, both during key generation and retroactively.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently implementing the **Interaktive Quiz-Funktionalit√§t** (Interactive Quiz Functionality), as explicitly requested by the user. This feature will transform the Schulungsportal into a more comprehensive e-learning platform by allowing users to take quizzes within courses and receive immediate feedback.

Specifically, the following actions have been taken:
- A new file, , has been created. This component is intended to handle the display and interaction logic for quizzes within the frontend.
- An attempt was made to create , but the file already existed, indicating that the  Shadcn UI component is available for use, likely for showing quiz or course completion progress.
- The quiz system is being integrated into the  component (or a similar component that renders course content for users). This involves modifying  and potentially other related files to include the  and manage quiz-related state and logic.
- Further edits were performed to integrate the quiz system, implying ongoing work on the frontend components to enable quiz display and functionality.
